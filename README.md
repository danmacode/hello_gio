# hello word for Gio graphics

`hello_gio.go` is my hello world program for the
Gio graphics package for Golang by Elias Naur.

Eschewing the elegant constraint layout system for
more direct control, `hello_gio.go` demonstrates how to
plot rectangular boxes at specific screen positions of your choosing.

It then demonstrates how to place labels over those boxes, and to clip
the text to stay inside the box.
